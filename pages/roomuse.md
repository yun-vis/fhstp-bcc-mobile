# Concept

## [Coroutine](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html#coroutine-context-and-behavior)
Applications often need to perform multiple tasks at the same time, such as responding to user input, loading data, or updating the screen. To support this, they rely on concurrency, which allows operations to run independently without blocking each other.

## [Kotlin coroutines on Android](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines)
A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously. Coroutines were added to Kotlin in version 1.3 and are based on established concepts from other languages.
