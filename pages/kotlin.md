# Syntax

- [W3 School Kotlin Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/kotlin/index.php)

# [Kotlin coroutines on Android](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines)
A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously. Coroutines were added to Kotlin in version 1.3 and are based on established concepts from other languages.

## enum class

## data class
data classes in Kotlin are primarily used to hold data. For each data class, the compiler automatically generates additional member functions.

## MutableStateFlow
- asStateFlow()

## [Initializer blocks](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#initializer-blocks)
The primary constructor initializes the class and sets its properties. In most cases, you can handle this with simple code.
If you need to perform more complex operations during instance creation, place that logic in initializer blocks inside the class body. These blocks run when the primary constructor executes.

## [Companion objects](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/object-declarations.html#companion-objects)
Companion objects allow you to define class-level functions and properties tied to a class, simplifying the creation and management of these instances.


# Terminology

- [Concurrency design pattern](https://www.baeldung.com/concurrency-principles-patterns): Concurrency design patterns are solutions for managing multiple operations that appear to run simultaneously, often in multi-threaded programs.

- [Higher-order functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/lambdas.html): A higher-order function is a function that takes functions as parameters, or returns a function.
