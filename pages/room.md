# Data

The codelab from the Android Developer documentation is too old and not usefull anymore, but here I am sending you my slides I used for the masterclass.
Since the slides are just for reference, here is the main documentation for it:
https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room
https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture
https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines

Also, since I do not have videos of my lecture on the topic, I think this YouTube video is helpful if you would like to reproduce an example for practicing:
