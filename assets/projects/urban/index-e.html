  <h1>Constrained Optimization for Disoccluding Geographic Landmarks in 3D Urban Maps</h1>
  <!--div id="publication"-->

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In composing hand-drawn 3D urban maps, the most common design
problem is to avoid overlaps between geographic features such
as roads and buildings by displacing them consistently over the map
domain. Nonetheless, automating this map design process is still a
challenging task because we have to maximally retain the 3D depth
perception inherent in pairs of parallel lines embedded in the original
layout of such geographic features. This paper presents a novel
approach to disoccluding important geographic features when creating
3D urban maps for enhancing their visual readability. This
is accomplished by formulating the design criteria as a constrained
optimization problem based on the linear programming approach.
Our mathematical formulation allows us to systematically eliminate
occlusions of landmark roads and buildings, and further controls the
degree of local 3D map deformation by devising an objective function
to be minimized. Various design examples together with a user
study are presented to demonstrate the robustness and feasibility of
the proposed approach.
  <h2>Constraints</h2>
<p>
There are five design criteria decided to be employed for improving the map readability, including
Fixed orientation (Figure 1(a)),
Relative position (Figure 1(b)),
Scale limits (Figure 1(c)),
Minimum displacement (Figure 1(d)), and
Occlusion avoidance (Figure 1(e)),

Note that the first three criteria are employed for keeping the con-
sistency in the arrangement of geographic features and formulated
as hard constraints, while the last two are introduced as soft constraints
for enhancing the reality and readability of 3D urban maps,
respectively.

Result 1: Side-by-side comparison between an ordinary perspective view (left) and its optimally distorted version with our approach (right). Note that we can successfully avoid the occlusions of important route to the destination (drawn in orange) while accentuating the 3D appearance of the landmark buildings.
